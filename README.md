# mom-java
Project for a course about distributed computing in Engineering school

The point was to replicate the behaviour of a MOM (Message Oriented Middleware).
We chose to implement a REST API with an application (only backend, front was displayed in terminal) which allows publish-subscribe interactions for topics, and peer to peer messages between applications
